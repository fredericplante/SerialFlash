Hey Mister Stoffregen,

I did not realy know how to reach you so Here it is :D

Anyway, do you plan futur expension of your library to make it work with Arduino Due and ESP8266? 
I know you might say that it already has support for the built on flash, on the ESP8266 case, but
it would be nice ta have a bigger then then 4MB internal thing.

Incase you have not eared of the ESP8266 device --> https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino <-- Worth the look!

Any way, you library totally rull 2 thumbs up. :D
